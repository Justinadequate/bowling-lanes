# bowling-lanes

The idea for this project came from the tumultuous period of time at a job where we were switching our task management software. After researching some, I got frustrated at the patronizing nature of some of them, playing elaborate animations and popping up congratulatory messages upon completing any little thing. So, I had the idea of a task management software that had the look and feel of 90s bowling alley software, complete with grotesque animations for every status.

I also wanted to dig into nodejs and GraphQL a little more, this being my first go at a nodejs backend, so I ended up turning it into a simple todo API that I had hooked up to a MongoDB instance. Overall I've enjoyed the experience so far.

In the future I would like to finish the basic CRUD operations and sub out the todo objects for thh actual task system (schema and architecture tbd), then move forward with the React client.
